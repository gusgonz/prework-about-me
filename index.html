      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Details here...</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Born and raised in Miami, FL. 
        Family moved to Georgia before I was in High School so Georgia partially claims me. 
        Mom is Dominican, Dad is Venezuelan
      </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Love playing and watching basketball, specifically NBA.
        Love hanging with my friends whether that be eating good food, going to concerts, or traveling.
        Really love traveling.
        Really like music: reggaeton, rap, and electronic 
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>NBA player for the Miami HEAT
        (actually still trying to figure this out - for now, a software engineer or techonology consultant)
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I stay in Johns Creek, GA</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Had a love for coding in school, but pursued an Industrial Engineering degree while at Georgia Tech.
        Started working as a business analyst on an scrum software development team, which has re-ignited my
        love for code. I want to be able to do, at a very high level, what the developers on my team do.
